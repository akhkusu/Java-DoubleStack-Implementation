# Java-DoubleStack-Implementation


This repository contains an implementation of a stack data structure in Java, specifically designed to handle double (floating-point) values. The stack implementation provides typical stack operations such as push, pop, and top-of-stack retrieval (tos), as well as additional functionalities like arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) on the stack elements. The implementation ensures efficient storage and retrieval of double values while maintaining the integrity of stack operations.
